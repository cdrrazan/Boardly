# 🤖 Boardly

### Put your GitHub Projects board on autopilot.

A config-driven GitHub Action that automates **GitHub Projects (v2)** — sprint rollover, stale-card nudges, sub-issue gating, digests, standups, and priority sorting — all from one YAML file.

## ✨ What it does

You point the action at a Project (v2), describe your rules in `.github/project-automation.yml`, and schedule it. On every run it reads the board, applies your enabled features, and writes an **audit trail** to the Actions job summary so you can see exactly what happened.

```

## 🚀 Features

| | Feature | What it does |
|:--:|---------|--------------|
| 🔁 | **Sprint rollover** | When an iteration ends, move unfinished items into the next iteration so nothing is stranded in a closed sprint. |
| 🔔 | **Stale-card nudges** | @-mention owners when a card sits in a status past a threshold. De-duped so it never spams. |
| 🧩 | **Sub-issue gating + roll-up** | Block a card from staying **Done** while it has open sub-issues; optionally write completion % into a progress field. |
| 🏁 | **Sprint digest** | At iteration end, post completed-vs-carried-over counts and velocity. |
| 🗓️ | **Daily standup** | Post what moved in the last _N_ hours, grouped by assignee. |
| 🔼 | **Priority auto-sort** | Reorder the board so higher-priority cards float to the top. |
| 📣 | **Slack & email notifications** | Also deliver digests, standups, and stale alerts to a Slack channel and/or over email — not just GitHub comments. |
| 📋 | **Audit trail** | Every action (or, in `dry-run`, every _intended_ action) is written to the job summary. |

## 📚 Use cases

Every feature comes with a standalone, copy-pasteable recipe — **who it's for**, the **config**, and **what happens**. Browse them all in [`docs/use-cases`](./docs/use-cases), or jump straight in:

## ⚡ Quick start

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[1 · Create a token<br/>Projects + Issues scope] --> B[2 · Add config<br/>.github/project-automation.yml]
    B --> C[3 · Add workflow<br/>.github/workflows/project-automation.yml]
    C --> D[4 · Dry-run to preview] --> E[5 · Flip dry-run off 🎉]
```

1. **Create a token.** The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` generally can't read org Projects. Create a fine-grained PAT or GitHub App token with **Projects: read & write** and **Issues: read & write**, and save it as a secret (e.g. `PROJECT_AUTOMATION_TOKEN`).

2. **Add config** at `.github/project-automation.yml` — start from [`project-automation.example.yml`](./project-automation.example.yml).

3. **Add a workflow** — see [`.github/workflows/example.yml`](./.github/workflows/example.yml):

   ```yaml
   - uses: cdrrazan/Boardly@v1
     with:
       token: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_AUTOMATION_TOKEN }}
       config-path: .github/project-automation.yml
       dry-run: "true"   # preview first; remove once it looks right
   ```

## 🧾 Inputs & outputs

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `token` | — _(required)_ | Token with `project` + `issues` access to the target project. |
| `config-path` | `.github/project-automation.yml` | Path to the config file. |
| `only` | `""` | Run just one feature: `rollover`, `stale-nudge`, `sub-issue-gate`, `digest`, `standup`, `priority-sort`. Empty runs every enabled feature. |
| `dry-run` | `false` | Log every intended action to the audit trail without making changes. |

**Output:** `actions-count` — number of mutating actions taken (or that would be taken in dry-run).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Everything is declared in one YAML file. Minimal example:

```yaml
project:
  owner: my-org
  type: org        # or "user"
  number: 5
fields:
  status: Status
  iteration: Sprint
  priority: Priority
doneStatuses: ["Done"]
features:
  rollover:
    enabled: true
  staleNudge:
    enabled: true
    rules:
      - status: "In Progress"
        days: 3
        notify: assignees
```

Full reference: [`project-automation.example.yml`](./project-automation.example.yml).

## 📣 Notifications (Slack & email)

By default, digests, standups, and stale alerts are posted to GitHub. You can **also** deliver them to a Slack channel and/or over email by adding a `notifications` block. Secrets are referenced by **environment-variable name** — never inline the webhook URL or SMTP password in config; pass them from encrypted secrets via the workflow's `env:`.

```yaml
# in project-automation.yml
notifications:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    webhookEnv: SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL      # env var with a Slack Incoming Webhook URL
  email:
    enabled: true
    host: smtp.example.com
    port: 587
    secure: false                      # true for port 465
    userEnv: SMTP_USER
    passwordEnv: SMTP_PASS
    from: "Boardly <bot@example.com>"
    to: ["team@example.com"]
```

```yaml
# in your workflow — map the secrets into the environment
- uses: cdrrazan/Boardly@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_AUTOMATION_TOKEN }}
  env:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
    SMTP_USER: ${{ secrets.SMTP_USER }}
    SMTP_PASS: ${{ secrets.SMTP_PASS }}
```

Both channels are optional and independent — enable either, both, or neither. A channel failure is logged as a warning and never aborts the run, and nothing is sent under `dry-run`. See the [notifications recipe](./docs/use-cases/13-notifications.md).

## 🧠 How it decides things

- **"Time in status"** is approximated by when the Status field value was last changed (Projects v2 exposes each field value's `updatedAt`). It is not a full status-history walk.
- **Iterations** come from the iteration field's configuration. Rollover and digest act on the most recently *completed* iteration; new work rolls into the first *active* iteration.
- **Sub-issues** use the native GitHub sub-issues API (`subIssuesSummary`), requested with the `sub_issues` GraphQL feature header.
- **Priority sort** uses `updateProjectV2ItemPosition`. Manual order only shows on a board view whose sort is set to **manual** — a field-sorted view overrides it.

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm test            # unit tests (node:test + tsx)
npm run build       # bundle src -> dist/index.js (committed; required for JS actions)
npm run all         # typecheck + test + build
```

The bundled `dist/index.js` is committed so the action runs without a build step. Rebuild and commit it whenever you change `src/`.
